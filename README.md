# Cycling-In-Vancouver

“CyclingInVancouver” is a fictional responsive website that provides platform and guides to enhance the cycling experience for cyclists in Vancouver. It is a Metro Vancouver route planner, which lets you plan a different kind of cycling routes from A to B by difficulties. It is designed by cyclist community, for the cyclist community, and give an easier start to the novice cyclist in Vancouver. A new cyclist can join the community by signing up and able to join group cycling formed by the community’s cyclist. It can also be used by tourist cyclist who enjoys finding new cycling route, cycling together and make new friends.

Information architecture, user interface and user experience were thoroughly assessed through the process of designing this responsive site. My role included defining the purpose of the website, competitive analysis, site-mapping, flow-charting, logo design, final visual design, and final prototype of responsive website.
